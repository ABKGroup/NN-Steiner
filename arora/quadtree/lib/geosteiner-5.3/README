========================================================================

This directory contains GeoSteiner version 5.3, which solves the
following NP-hard problems:

	- Euclidean Steiner minimal tree
	- Rectilinear Steiner minimal tree
	- Uniformly-oriented Steiner minimal trees (including hexagonal
	  and octilinear Steiner minimal trees)
	- Minimum spanning tree in hypergraphs

The code is written in ANSI C and requires no supplementary software
or libraries. 

Geosteiner is the joint work of:

	- David Warme		Group W
	- Pawel Winter		University of Copenhagen
	- Martin Zachariasen	University of the Faroe Islands

Additional programming assistance was provided by:

	- Benny K. Nielsen	University of Copenhagen
	- Daniel Juhl		University of Copenhagen

Building and Installing GeoSteiner
==================================

you who are especially impatient, type the following:

	./configure
	make

For complete instructions on building and installing Geosteiner, see
the INSTALL file.

User's Guide and Reference Manual
=================================

The manual describes the GeoSteiner callable library in full
detail. It also documents each of the stand-alone programs
accompanying the callable library. The manual (named manual.pdf or
manual.ps) is avaiable on the GeoSteiner homepage; it can also be
built by   

	make manual.pdf
or
	make manual.ps

Below are a few examples of program invocation.

The following command will generate a set of 70 random points and
compute a rectilinear Steiner minimal tree for it:

	rand_points 70 | rfst | bb

The following (Bourne shell) examples can be used to generate complete
printable postscript plots for the same problem:

	(cat prelude.ps; rand_points 70 | rfst | bb) >rsmt70.ps

For more examples, please consult the manual.
