# NN-Steiner
The repo is to reproduce the results in the paper: **NN-Steiner: A Mixed Neural-algorithmic Approach for the Rectilinear Steiner Minimum Tree Problem**. 

### Environment
````
python == 3.10
torch
numpy
matplotlib
hydra-core
rtree
tqdm
scikit-learn
tensorboard
````

### Extract model

````
tar -xzvf models/m\=15_kb\=4.tar.gz
````

### Build Geosteiner
Note that the numbers reported in the paper are attained by Geosteiner compiled by cplex, but we cannot distribute anything compiled by cplex. If you have cplex, you can compile the `libgeosteiner.a` in `arora/quadtree/lib/geosteiner-5.3` by cplex.
````
cd arora/quadtree/lib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
````

### Build RMST
````
cd arora/quadtree/rmst
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
````

### Execution
Evecution apart from the files in `evaluator` are all done through setting the configs in `conf/config.yaml` and running this command
````
python -m arora
````

### Reproduce
You can reproduce the results for NN-Steiner by running
````
bash exp/nn.sh
bash exp/ratio_flute.sh
````

### Training
To train the model, you should first produce your training data by setting the `conf/config.yaml` file. Now the training only supports GPU. If you have multiple GPUs, the training is automatically distributed on those GPUs.
````
flow: 
  - data_gen
data_gen:
  batch: <num_instances>
  num_points: <num_points>
  x_range: <x_range>
  y_range: <y_range>
  x_stdev: <x_stdev>
  y_stdev: <y_stdev>
  level: <number of levels of full quadtree, -1 if no constraint>
  output: tensor
  type: mlp
  precision: 32
  fst: 1
````
The training data will be in the `data` directory.

Then start the training by setting the `conf/config.yaml`
````
flow: 
  - train
train:
  train_set: data/<train_set>
  val_set: data/<val_set>
  test_set: data/<test_set>
  epochs: <epochs>
  max_no_update: <early stopping without improvement fot this number of evaluations>
  val_save: <true | false, whether to save the model for every evaluation or just the best model>
  lr: <learning rate>
  portal_weight: <this number + 1 is the portal weight ratio>
  batch_size: <batch_size>
  val_batch_size: <val_batch_size>
  test_batch_size: <test_batch_size>
  eval: <evaluate every this number of epoch>
````
The trained models will be in `outputs/yyyy-mm-dd/hh-mm-ss/train/model`.
